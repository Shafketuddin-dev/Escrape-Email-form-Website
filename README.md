# Escrape-Email-form-Website
## In this project, the main target is to scrape email addresses from websites. We use Google Apps Script for hosting and code it with JavaScript. When a user inputs a list of website addresses, up to 500 in total, this code searches inside these websites and attempts to scrape email addresses. It uses Google Spreadsheet as temporary storage and displays the results in the output.##
